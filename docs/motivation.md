# Motivation and Contents

I have used my expertise to configure and assemble these simulations using ROS 2 Jazzy and Ubuntu 24.04. This process is a significant barrier for many professionals, students, and professors I have encountered. It requires deep knowledge of operating systems, simulation architectures, transformation trees, event-based architectures, coding, algebra, networking, and other specialized fields, which are uncommon for one person to master. Therefore, this project is intended for anyone interested in working with mobile robotics, specifically in multi-robot settings, who doesn't have the time or budget to assemble this foundation themselves.
