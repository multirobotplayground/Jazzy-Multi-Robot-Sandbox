I have used some of my expertise to configure and assemble these simulations using ROS 2 Jazzy and Ubuntu 24.04, as this is a major barrier for most professionals, students, and professors who have crossed paths with me. It requires expertise and a deep understanding of operating systems, simulation architectures, transformation trees, event-based architectures, coding, algebra, networking, and many other fields that are uncommon for one person to master. Therefore, this project is intended for anyone interested in working with mobile robotics, specifically in multi-robot settings, who doesn't have the time or budget to assemble this base themselves. Below, I share some experiences and explain why I decided to opt for the Open Source initiative.

## [Letter to the Community](#letter-to-the-community-link)

Before you read this statement, I would like to clarify that I'm developing this Open Source software because I'm truly tired of the academic and private sectors, as well as people who have little to offer but prefer competing against others instead of collaborating and nurturing. From my experiences, I've realized that both academia and the private sector are not very healthy environments, mainly because people often pursue their own agendas and compete against others rather than collaborating and nurturing. This behavior is something I have engaged in myself when I was younger. Many researchers I've met discuss this issue, and it is corroborated by the fact that Open Source initiatives with relevant work is not common in the academia, for example, and often come in the form of unfinished work that the author is comfortable sharing.

I believe this is mostly true because people may feel a little bit better knowing that their place in the world could be guaranteed over someone elseâ€™s with a better research, a better product, a better laboratory, a better student, a better department, a better software, and so on. Most laboratories do not share ongoing research or state-of-the-art methods but rather peripheral works, which is something people often discuss in meetings. This statement may seem a bit radical, however, I would like to clarify that these views are not entirely mine, and I could support them with examples.

Another significant problem that anyone with a basic intellect can realize is the peer-review system, but I will let you think about that on your own. I believe that this treacherous environment could be inherent to human nature, just like the need to eat, breathe, and drink water, and is exacerbated by the lack of funding, lack of appreciation for one's expertise and experiences, people constantly trying to steal expertise for personal gain, lack of honesty and sincerity, and lack of intellectual maturity, which amplify selfish behaviors that are harmful to society.

Furthermore, to avoid letting this statement be thrown out without further discussion, one should note that interests must be satisfied for this world to work. This is an argument you can extrapolate on if you wish, and it implies that people are inclined to further their agendas by stepping over others without facing consequences. Consequently, even though I am from an emerging country in a very competitive environment with a nonexistent budget and a wage that is disproportionate to my efforts and expertise, I am glad to share some content with the community that could be useful.

Finally, I would like to ask you, if any of this content is useful to you, please at least mention this repository as required by the adopted license terms. If I can help you with anything, please let me known and I will be very glad and look forward to any collaboration.
